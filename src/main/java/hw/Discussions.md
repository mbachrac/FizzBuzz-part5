Part 2

If n were not an argument but a fixed number, the program could have a set array to print out. Now, with the number not known, the program must cycle through the numbers from one till the specified number and test to see if they are divisible by three or five or both.

Part 3

I could have made a test class to test the main. I could have made an array and tested to see if that array is equal to the array that the main class made before printing it out.

Part 4

The things that changed between parts 2 and 3 are minor changes that had to be made in order to have the method do the work and return the array as apposed to the main just printing out the array. One part is that the method had to save each string to an array and not just print it out. Also, there had to be a test statement to see if the number entered is valid or not. The actual code that checks each number to see if it is divisible by 3 or 5 or both stays the same. Between parts 3 and 4, the only changes are the arrays are now lists so instead of saying the next part of the array, we say list.add(). Also, I had to switch my test class to create lists instead of arrays so that I can test the arrays. The formulas themselves, though, stayed the same.
